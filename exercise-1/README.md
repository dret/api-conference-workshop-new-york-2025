# API Conference New York 2025: Exercise 1 (API Business Models)

The goal of this exercise is to find opportunities where APIs would add value in your organization or setting. There are many ways how APIs can create value, and we are looking for some ideas that you have from your current state of affairs.

There are no wrong answers here, the only purpose is to start thinking about an API truly from the outside in:

- If you (as part of the organization) or external users such as a partner or the public would be able to access this data and/or capability, this would create a new value stream for the organization.

- Value doesn't necessarily mean money. It means anything aligned with your organization's mission. If you're a public institution or a non-profit, value means that you're doing a better job at realizing your organization's goals.

- We'll focus on drilling down into the API's functions in [Exercise 2 (API Stories)](../exercise-2), for now the only goal is to identify areas where there is value to be realized.
